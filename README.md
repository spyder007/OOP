# OOP

Code from Object-Oriented Programing Course in Fall 2023. These are all files from completed assignments in the OOP course of Fall 2023

Assignment 1 includes

* maincpp
* customer.h
* customer.cpp

The purpose of Assignment 1 was to read a file in format:

```text
First name
Last Name
Old meter
New meter
```

To calculate an electric bill
With no errors, these new record are placed in a file called `output.txt` in the following format:

```text
Last name, first name    bill
```

When an error was detected, which in this case was nothing in the name space or a meter reading over 9999, it was placed in an error file in the same format as it was read.
